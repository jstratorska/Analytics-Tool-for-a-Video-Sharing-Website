## Analytics tool for a video-sharing website

A website that aggregates and analyses YouTube data. The users can log into their YouTube account and see several statistics about the videos that they have added to their playlists such as the number of likes,  views, and comments and how they change over time. They can also compare them with different graphs and see a prediction for the next 12 hours for each statistic of each video.
